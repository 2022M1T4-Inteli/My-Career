**😊 Why?**

We developed an application for a digital bank focused on open finance resources, the main pain we seek to solve is the lack of knowledge about what open finance is and what it is useful for, the application is highly transparent and brings which and how user data is used through open finance in the tools used by the user, we give the user the why, how and what for.

The name CBank derives from the name Cyrcle Bank as it is a decentralized networked bank with all the user's banks i.e. there is not one bank in which the tools and processes are used and not one bank that finalizes this connection loop as they are corresponding, not forgetting that our team of developers are out of the box.
